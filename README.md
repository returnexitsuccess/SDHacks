#Gold 2.0

##Inspiration
GOLD is the online course catalog and registration website for UCSB students and... it kinda sucks. Information is segmented between different pages which makes it hard to plan schedules for the present and the future. We wanted to change that.

##What it does
We built a chrome extension which takes all the information about a class, usually split between different pages, and displays it all on the list of classes.

##How we built it
We used Javascript inside the chrome extension to manipulate the various pages on which the course information was shown. When a user requests certain information, the extension fetches the webpage in the background and displays the relevant information from that page without loading a new page.

##What's next for Gold 2.0
We have a lofty vision for the future of this project and it's hard to choose where to start. We're looking towards customizing the extension to the user's major and remaining graduation requirements, improving the look and feel of the extension, and much more. The brainstorming for this one still hasn't stopped among our team.
